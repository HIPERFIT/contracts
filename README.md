# Introduction [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HIPERFIT/contracts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HIPERFIT/contracts)


This is an implementation of a simple financial contract language in
Haskell (see [Haskell](Haskell) subdirectory). The implementation is
accompanied by a Coq formalisation (see [Coq](Coq) subdirectory). The
contract language and its Coq formalisation is documented in the
accompanying [technical report](doc/report.pdf).  The Haskell
implementation is based on previous implementation in Standard ML (see
[SML](SML) subdirectory).
