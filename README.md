# Certified Symbolic Management of Financial Multi-Party Contracts [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HIPERFIT/contracts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HIPERFIT/contracts)

This is a certified implementation of a financial multi-party contract
language. The Coq-based certified implementation of the language is
found in the [Coq](Coq) subdirectory. The contract language and its
verified Coq implementation are documented in the accompanying
[ICFP 2015 paper](doc/icfp2015.pdf);
the [README file](Coq/README.md) provides an overview of the Coq
proofs. Moreover, this repository also includes earlier prototype
implementations of the contract language in Haskell (see
[Haskell](Haskell) subdirectory) and Standard ML (see [SML](SML)
subdirectory).
